# Prompts

This directory contains utility prompts used in the Open-LLM-VTuber project. These are general-purpose prompts that are not specific to any character's persona.

## Examples of Utility Prompts

*   **Live2D Expressions:** Prompts that inform the LLM about available Live2D expressions.
*   **Tool Usage:** Prompts that guide the LLM on how to use available tools.
*   ... and many more.

## Character Persona Prompts

**Important:** Character persona prompts (the prompts that define the personality of your AI characters) are **NOT** stored in this directory.

They are located in:
*   Your main `conf.yaml` file.
*   The YAML files within the `characters/` directory if you are defining multiple characters.
